      <p>I'm a San Antonio native, and still live here to this day. Was lucky enough to marry my highschool sweetheart and still remain with her to this day. Have a passion for scifi horror media as well as dark fantasy. Loves tabletop RPGs though hasn't had the fortune of playing much at all. Coding is something I've always wanted to learn since I've always had a fascination with computers and being able to watch them evolve throughout my life has only made me more curious.</p>
